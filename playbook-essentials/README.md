# **STRATIM Essentials**

**What is STRATIM Essentials?**

Running within the STRATIM Marketplace is our very own premium vendor fleet service. We call this fleet service STRATIM Essentials.

Transportation Services

This is our inaugural and largest fleet service. The Essentials workforce, powered by the STRATIM Workforce App and dispatched tasks through the STRATIM Vendor Portal, transport vehicles from A to B on behalf of our clients.

Storage Services

We also provide vehicle storage leasing to clients in targeted locations around the country.

Future Services

Our transportation and storage services are the the first of many fleet services we will offer as the STRATIM Essentials brand expands and grows. We plan to build out a full suite of services where we can leverage our competitive advantage in workforce onboarding and management, reliability, and ease of use, all powered by the STRATIM platform, to enable our clients to run highly efficient fleets at scale. 

**How does this services business fit within a tech company?**

STRATIM Essentials plays an extremely important role in the business in four ways:

1. Premium - It’s the best in the game - it goes above and beyond to delight our clients and through this it grows the business.

2. Enabler - The STRATIM Essentials business is a key driver of growth at the company. STRATIM Essentials’ success is powered by the STRATIM Platform and in turn its success enables the company to build out more technology, making the STRATIM Platform stronger.

3. Beachhead - Many clients’ first introduction to the STRATIM Platform comes through the ordering of services from STRATIM Essentials, which can solve an immediate, tangible problem for these clients.

4. Flagbearer- It’s the ultimate case study for Vendors - it is our most effective tool to convince third party Vendors to become customers of the STRATIM Platform.
