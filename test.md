## What are The STRATIM Playbooks?

The STRATIM Playbooks acts as an mainstay for our core beliefs which determine our strategy and the way that we work.

## These Playbooks will:

* Anchor what it means to be STRATIM
* Be a reference point when weâ€™re trying to make strategic decisions
* Introduce new hires to our culture and vision

There are separate Playbooks in development to help guide specific teams, functions and processes such as _engineering_, _sales_, and _product_.
