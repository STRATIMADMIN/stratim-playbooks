Deep dive: How does the STRATIM Platform work?

Centralizes

STRATIM connects all customer operations in a central hub \(the portal\) they control.

Automates

STRATIM eliminates repetitive tasks and simplifies complex operational tasks, unchaining the business from human error and outdated processes.

Distributes

STRATIM sends tasks out to their workforce optimizing fleet routes for maximum efficiency.

Optimizes

STRATIM analyzes the data it receives from your connected operations, and uses it to deliver smart recommendations that uncover inefficiencies and unlock insights.

STRATIM Marketplace

Underpinning the software is STRATIM’s Marketplace, this where the clients and vendors can connect and work with each other directly through the platform.

Clients can find vendors to expand their fleet offerings or optimize their existing services.

Vendors can find and acquire new clients directly through the Vendor Portal. They can also connect with other vendors to expand their offerings to Clients.

Both customers take advantage of the STRATIM Marketplace to grow their business, drive down costs and create new services that delight their end-users.

When a client and a vendor connect through the Marketplace, STRATIM acts as the clearing house processing the payments between both of our customers. It also takes care of all the admin from contracts to invoicing.

STRATIM Essentials

Running alongside our software and marketplace, we also have our very own premium vendor fleet services. We call these fleet services STRATIM Essentials.

Our inaugural fleet service is transportation. The Essentials workforce transport vehicles from A to B on behalf of our customers, using the STRATIM Workforce App.

This is the first of many fleet services we hope to offer as STRATIM Essentials as we stretch for our goal of powering everything that moves.

STRATIM Essentials plays and extremely important role in the business in three ways:

Premium - It’s the best in the game - it goes above and beyond to delight our customers and through this it grows the business.

Money maker - It generates the majority of our current revenue, it’s efforts support the technology that’s being built in the business.

Flagbearer - It’s the ultimate case study for Vendors - it is our most effective tool to convince third party Vendors to become customers of the STRATIM Platform.
