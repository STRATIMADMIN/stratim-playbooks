## The State of Our Industry {#stateofourindustry}

### A New Era Of Mobility Is Approaching

The transportation industry is undergoing a major transformation. Market forces and technological advances are redefining how vehicles are owned, used and managed.

#### From Buying to Using Vehicles

Owning a vehicle is no longer the most convenient or cost effective way to get from A to B. Instead, vehicles are being amassed into fleets by corporations. These then offer consumers the ability to use vehicles for their transportation needs under an as-needed model.

#### From Low Vehicle Utilization to High Vehicle Utilization

In the past, vehicles were largely inactive; they sat idle in parking lots or driveways for 90% of the time. Now, emerging business models are putting these idle assets to work—increasing the amount of time a single vehicle is on the road and simultaneously decreasing the number of vehicles that are needed.

#### From Driving Around to being Driven Around

The ability to drive oneself around has historically been considered a luxury; a sign of freedom. But this trend is waning. Instead, consumers are finding freedom in unchaining themselves from a vehicle they need to maintain and drive. They are migrating to being moved around by professionals, and soon after, by AI. 

As a result, an entire industry is in a state of flux. This represents a huge opportunity for us…

## We Believe {#ourvision}

#### Fleets will become the backbone of transportation

A handful of corporations will own massive fleets of vehicles, each of which will continuously move large numbers of people around everyday. The outcome will be fleets numbering hundreds of thousands of vehicles, each producing personalized transportation experiences that add significant complexity in the form of maintenance, oversight, and logistics needs – all at tremendous scale.

#### Automation, AI & ML will solve unsolved inefficiencies in fleet management

Systems of intelligence that leverage connected vehicle data will lower operational costs and increase utilization of fleets, removing the human error risk of current fleet management. Instead of sticky notes, clip pads, text messages and spreadsheets, real time algorithmic tools will make the same set of decisions as their human fleet management counterparts, but with far more precision.

#### Disparate systems will be unified

Companies who previously thrived on business units operating independently are now becoming their own bottlenecks. Operations, customer success, inventory management and maintenance teams can no longer work in silos as part of an effective transportation company. The unification of systems, teams and procedures across the transportation industry will allow companies to unlock efficiencies and gain new insights that have never before been available. 

#### Platforms will become the fabric for the transportation industry

Like electricity grids and water systems for cities, software-based platforms will act as the digital plumbing for an industry that, to date, has operated on an analog plane. 

That’s where STRATIM comes in...

## Our Vision {#ourvision}

### STRATIM will be the underlying infrastructure that powers everything that moves.

The future of transportation will be powered by intelligent, highly-efficient fleets optimized by real-time data, machine learning and AI technologies.

This is only half the story. These fleets, as smart as they may be, still need to be maintained, repaired, washed, and moved around. This highly complex logistical operation will be shouldered by humans for the foreseeable future.

To create the future of intelligent fleets, where management and maintenance are simple, intuitive, and frictionless, we’re building the infrastructure necessary to modernize operations, unify systems, optimize logistics and enable transportation companies to deliver better, more modern mobility experiences.

## How We Win {#howwewin}

### We’re enabling the future of mobility by removing operational complexity for our customers.

While others offer segmented software or service solutions, we believe in a complete platform for the transportation industry which houses a holistic suite of software and services, all under a single roof.

STRATIM wins when we are the only platform needed to run a transportation company. Winning means we have unchained our customers’ resources so they can focus on growing their business, not running it.

To achieve this, we must:

#### Out-Execute Our Competition

Our largest customers \(as well as established software outfits\) will always work to replicate our roadmap. Our recipe for success is executing our solutions faster and smarter than our competition is able to.

#### Building With Purpose

We don’t just do things quickly; we do things intelligently and with purpose. We don’t carry around the tax of a legacy software infrastructure or management structure, so our internal operations run smoother and leaner than the competition. 

#### Being An Outsider

Our leadership team does not have a transportation background. Instead, we are technologists who understand how digital capabilities will forever transform industries and operations. This is one of our greatest assets, and allows us to solve problems with data, analytics and software.

## Our Customers {#whoareourcustomers}

Companies that **own fleets of vehicles. **We call them **Clients**.

Companies that **service fleets of vehicles.** We call them **Vendors**.

### Clients

There are several verticals that our customers classify themselves under.

Rideshare \| Carshare \| Rental \| Manufacturers \| Dealership

While these verticals are different flavors of the same base concept—corporate fleets—we believe that offering solutions based on client-defined verticals is critical. And, at the same time, as more transportation companies transition to fleet ownership, the barriers between these verticals will break down. 

### Vendors

There are numerous types of services that are needed to keep a fleet fully functional.

Transportation \| Storage \| Fueling/Charging \| Washing \| Parts Replacement

Vendors typically specialize in performing individual services to fleets, and we believe that specialization to be a good thing.

### Who Our Customers Are Not

Clearly defining what something **is not** is just as important as saying what is. 

As a B2B organization, our customers have their own customers. We call those customers “end-users” because, at the end of the day, they are the ones utilizing our clients’ fleets. 

Today, we do not consider these end-users to be our customers. Instead, we enable businesses to serve their end-users, but we do not transact directly with them. 

This will likely change in the future--we believe that a complete platform for the transportation industry will ultimately include end-user management.

## Our Offerings {#ourofferings}

### STRATIM Platform

This is the lynchpin of STRATIM: a full software suite designed to maximize the performance and profitability of our customers’ fleets and workforces. It provides a simple yet powerful way to drive down costs at scale and increase the value of existing assets.

Our software enables clients and vendors to centrally manage all aspects of their business with a modern interface that tracks, routes, analyzes and controls their assets, whether those are fleets, a workforce or both.

It leverages computer-driven workflows to remove human errors and decision-making throughout the organization and ultimately, optimize transportation logistics and operations.

The STRATIM Platform connects all customer operations into a central hub called the Portal. By automating repetitive tasks and streamlining complex workflows, the STRATIM Platform optimizes fleet routes and distributes tasks for maximum efficiency. From there, it collects the data received from connected operations, and delivers insights on how to further advance  fleet operations.

The software is separated into two products, one for each customer segment:

The **Client Portal**: A full software suite to maximize the performance and profitability of their **fleets**.

The **Vendor Portal**: A full suite of software tools to maximize the performance and profitability of their **workforce**.

### STRATIM Marketplace

Underpinning the STRATIM Platform is the STRATIM Marketplace. This is where clients and vendors can connect and transact with each other. It provides one central vantage point for clients and vendors to manage what is typically a massive web of relationships.

Our Clients and Vendors can do this in two ways:

1. By plugging in all their pre-existing relationships to centralize operations, increase efficiency and gain valuable transparency. 
2. By finding and contracting with new partners to accelerate the growth of their business.

Vendors can also subcontract with other vendors in the STRATIM Marketplace to offer more holistic services to Clients. When Vendors work together on the STRATIM Platform, we call these relationships “Vendor Partners”.

Whenever clients and vendors connect through the STRATIM Marketplace, STRATIM acts as the clearing house by processing payments between both customers. It also simplifies all the admin, from contracts right through to invoicing. 

### STRATIM Essentials
