## The State of Our Industry {#stateofourindustry}

### A New Era Of Mobility Is Approaching

The transportation industry is undergoing a major transformation. Market forces and technological advances are redefining how vehicles are owned, used and managed.

#### From Buying to Using Vehicles

Owning a vehicle is no longer the most convenient or cost effective way to get from A to B. Instead, vehicles are being amassed into fleets by corporations who then offer consumers the ability to use these vehicles for their transportation needs with an as needed model.

#### From Low Vehicle Utilization to High Vehicle Utilization

In the past vehicles were largely inactive; they lay idle in parking lots or driveways 90% of the time. For the first time emerging business models are putting these idle assets to work — increasing the amount of time a single vehicle is on the road and simultaneously decreasing the overall amount of vehicles that are needed.

#### From Driving Around to being Driven Around

The ability to drive oneself around has historically been considered a luxury; sign of freedom. But this trend is waning. Instead consumers are finding freedom in unchaining themselves from a vehicle they need to maintain and drive. They are migrating to being moved around by professionals, and soon after that AI.

An entire industry is in a state of flux presenting a huge opportunity for us…

## Our Vision {#ourvision}

### STRATIM will be the underlying infrastructure that powers everything that moves.

We don't believe that those in the transportation industry who have been successful in the past are guaranteed to be successful in the future. Instead we see a new set of truths that govern success. It is the companies that adapt who will be successful.

#### Fleets will become the backbone of transportation

A handful of corporations are going to own a massive amount of vehicles. These huge fleets will be continuously moving vast amounts of people around everyday. The outcome is fleets in the hundreds of thousands that produce a mobility experience but come with maintenance and oversights needs. At this large scale the complexity of owning vehicle's increases exponentially.

#### Automation, AI & ML will solve unsolved inefficiencies in fleet management

Systems of intelligence, that leverage connected vehicle data, will lower operational costs and increase utilization of fleets by removing the natural error in human driven fleet management. Instead of sticky notes, clip pads, text messages and spreadsheets, real time algorithmic tools will make the same set of decisions as their human fleet management counterparts but with far more precision.

#### Disparate systems will be unified

Companies who have thrived on business units operating independently are becoming their own bottleneck. Operations, customer success, inventory management and maintenance teams can no longer work autonomously to produce a transportation company. The unification of systems, teams and procedures across a transportation offering will allow companies to unlock efficiencies and gain new insights.

#### Platforms will become the fabric for the transportation industry

Like electricity grids and water systems for cities, software based platforms will act as the plumbing for an industry that to date as operated on an analog plane.

This is where STRATIM comes in.

## How We Win {#howwewin}

### We’re enabling the future of mobility by solving operational complexity for our customers.

While others offer segmented software or service solutions, at STRATIM we fundamentally believe that a true platform for the transportation industry will house a holistic suite of software and service under a single roof. STRATIM win’s when we are the only platform needed to run a transportation company. And when wins, we unchain our customers resources so they can be focused on growing their business, not running it.

#### Out-Execute Our Competition

Our largest customers as well as established software outfits will always work to replicate our roadmap; our recipe for success is turning out solutions faster than their own internal efforts.

#### Building With Purpose

It’s not just that we do things quickly, we do things intelligently and with purpose. We don’t carry around with the tax of legacy software infrastructure or management structure; our internal operations run smoother and leaner than the competition.

#### Being An Outsider

Our leadership team does not have a transportation background - instead we are technologist. This is one of our greatest assets; we solve problems with data, software and automation.

## Our Customers {#whoareourcustomers}

Companies that **own fleets of vehicles** -- We call them **Clients**.

Companies that **service fleets of vehicles** -- We call them **Vendors**.

### Clients

There are several verticals that our customers classify themselves under.

Rideshare \| Carshare \| Rental \| Manufacturers \| Dealership

While these verticals are different favors of the same base concept - corporate fleets - we believe that offering solutions based on client defined vertical is critical. Still, as more companies in the transportation industry become aware of the transition from ownership to usage, we believe more businesses will move to own and manage their own fleets in all verticals.

### Vendors

There are numerous types of services that are needed to keep a fleet fully functional.

Transportation \| Storage \| Fueling/Charging \| Washing \| Parts Replacement

We believe vendor categories are real and distinct so the list referenced is not exhaustive. Vendors specialise in performing different types of services to fleets and that is a good thing.

### Who Our Customers Are Not

Clearly defining what something is not is just as important as saying what is.

As a B2B business, our customers have their own customers. We call these customers the end-users because, at the end of the day, the use our customers fleets. Today we do not consider end-users our customers. We enable businesses to serve their end-users, but we do not transact with end-users directly.

This will likely change in the future as a true platform for the transportation industry includes end-user management.
