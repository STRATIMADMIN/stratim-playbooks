##  {#whoarewe}

## Who are we? {#whoarewe}

We are a team of pioneers that thrive in complexity. Where others see chaos, we see opportunity. We believe there’s beauty and tremendous value in transforming complexity into something elegant, simple and intuitive. This belief governs everything that we do.

Today we’re solving complexity in the transportation industry.

The transportation industry is incredibly inefficient and weighed down by outdated operational processes - this costs businesses a huge amount of time and money. The industry is also on the cusp of a major transformation. Market forces and technological advances are redefining how vehicles are owned and used. Businesses are all fighting to remain relevant in a hyper competitive market, largely driven by consumers not CEOs. \(as they do this operational complexity increases and gets in the way of growth\) Those that win will solve the operational complexity and focus their time on creating value for their customers. Not running the backend of their business.

That’s where we come in!

## Our Mission {#ourmission}

#### We exist to enable businesses to build the future of mobility.

We do this by providing the software and services that solve operational complexity for our customers, automating the back-end of their business and unchaining their resources to dedicate on growing their business, not running it.

#### Our software and services are the underlying infrastructure that will power everything that moves.

With the X industry in flux, everyone is placing their bets how the future will turn out. Will it be ride sharing, car sharing, autonomous vehicles? No matter what future plays out we’ll be there. We’ll be powering the next generation of mobility companies from behind the scenes. We’ll play a pivotal role as a catalyst of this seismic shift in the way vehicles are used.

## Our Vision - _\*CONTENT TBC\*_ {#ourvision}

We believe that whatever the future holds, there are some basic underlying core principles that will drive all this change and our job is to enable the industry to be ready:

1. From BUYING to USING vehicles
2. Fewer cars will be sold and their going to be used more
3. From DRIVING around to being DRIVEN around
4. Moving from ownership to usage. Usage is called ride sharing.

There’s a change afoot. Cell phone bill… moving to usage. Huge flux, scaring people and we see opportunity in this change. With all this uncertainty we see a big opportunity.

Whatever usage based model wins we’re going to be there

### Facts of the future

1. Buying to using vehicles
2. Fewer cars sold and they’re going to be used more
3. From driving around to being driven around

### A note on who are customers are not:

We do not consider end-users our customers. We’ll enable businesses to serve their end-users, but we do not transact with them. Unless a Vendor’s end-user happens to be our Client.

As a B2B business both our customers also have their own customers. They use STRATIM to provide a superior service to them. For clarity, we call our Clients and Vendors own customers end-users. End-users to not transact with STRATIM and will probably not even know we’re there, but they are however the benefitting from STRATIM existing.

_Note: Whenever an end-user is a business and not a consumer our goal is to turn those end-user businesses into new customers. _

## What do we have for our customers? {#whatdowehaveforourcustomers}

We have software, our own fleet services and a network of businesses to access at the tap of a button.

### STRATIM Platform {#stratimplatform}

This is the software that powers our customers fleet operations. It’s split into two separate products for each customer type:

#### Client

A full software suite to maximize the performance & profitability of their fleets. Providing a simple way to scale their business without increasing operational complexity.

#### Vendor

A full suite of software tools maximize the performance & profitability of their workforce. Providing a simple way to scale their business without increasing operational complexity.

### STRATIM Marketplace {#stratimmarketplace}

Underpinning the **STRATIM Platform** is the **STRATIM Marketplace**, this is where clients and vendors can connect, transact and work with each other.

**Clients** can do this in two ways:

1. They can plug in all their pre-existing vendors to increase efficiency and transparency of relationships.
2. They can access a range of new vendors to fully optimize their fleets.

**Vendors** can do this in two ways:

1. They can plug in all their pre-existing clients.
2. They can find and acquire new clients.

Vendors can also connect and work with other vendors in the **STRATIM Marketplace**. They can do this to expand their service offerings to Clients. When Vendors work together on the **STRATIM Platform** we call these relationships **Vendor Partners**.

Whenever clients and vendors connect through the Marketplace, STRATIM acts as the clearing house processing the payments between both of our customers. It also simplifies all the admin taking from contracts right through to invoicing.

Additional relationships create additional complexity

### STRATIM Essentials {#stratimessentials}

Running within the **STRATIM Marketplace** are our very own premium vendor fleet services. We call these fleet services **STRATIM Essentials**.

#### Transportation Services

This is our inaugural fleet service. The Essentials workforce, powered by the **STRATIM Workforce App**, transport vehicles from A to B on behalf of our customers.

#### Parking Services
