# Book Cover

The Stratim Playbook acts as an mainstay for our core beliefs which determine our strategy and the way that we work. 



This playbook will:

Anchor what it means to be Stratim

Be a reference point when weâ€™re trying to make strategic decisions

Introduce new hires to our culture and vision



There are separate playbooks in development to help guide specific teams, functions and processes such as engineering, sales, and product.
